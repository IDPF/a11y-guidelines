			<h2>Links</h2>

			<section id="xhtm043-desc" class="usage">
				<p>Hyperlinking text seems like such an innocuous thing to do that most people don't consider the nuisance
					and problems that the links can cause to the reading experience.</p>
				<p epub:type="bridgehead">Context</p>
				<p>One of the first sins committed when creating hyperlinks is that the text inside of the link does not
					provide the full context of what is being linked to. The assumption most people make is that links are
					only encountered where they are placed in the text, when in reality many assistive technologies will
					present all of the links to the reader prior to beginning to read the content. The result can be a
					confusing mess of "see here" and "read more" link text being offered with no indication of where those
					links go.</p>
				<p>To avoid this problem, always ensure that the text you hyperlink is meaningful on its own. If you can read
					the link out of the context of its surrounding prose, and it clearly indicates where links to, you will
					improve the experience for readers using ATs.</p>
				<p>If it's not possible for the linked text to convey the meaning, add a <code>title</code> attribute to the
						<code>a</code> tag explaining its nature.</p>
				<p epub:type="bridgehead">Overuse</p>
				<p>A more complicated issue with links is the number to include in a document. The more that you use, the
					more inconvenience it can cause to your readers. For example, keyboard users may have to tab through all
					of the links to get to specific locations and, as noted above, some readers may be presented every link
					in the document. Another problem is that linked text is often preceded by the word "link" being announced
					to the reader, which can disrupt the reading experience when done in excess.</p>
				<p>The complicating factor is that generous hyperlinking can also be of benefit to many readers, too.
					Keywords are often hyperlinked to their definitions, for example, which can quickly lead to tens and
					hundreds of hyperlinked words in a chapter. Although an impediment to some readers, the ease of access
					often facilitate the process for readers with learning disabilities and cognitive issues.</p>
				<p>Removing redunant links from EPUBs is a good idea, but what constitutes redundant linking has to be
					addreesed on a case-by-case basis. Hyperlinking only the first instance of a keyword in each chapter
					might be one method of reducing the overall number, for example.</p>
				<p epub:type="bridgehead">Perception</p>
				<p>Another problem with links is that they cannot always be perceived by a reader (e.g., color blindness may
					make the links imperceptible from the surrounding text), in which case the person will not be aware that
					they are potentially missing access to information.</p>
				<p>To avoid the problem of links blending into their surroundings, hyperlinked text should be discoverable by
					more than just its color. Underlining of links is not required, but some other visual cue should be
					provided if underlines are removed (e.g., increased bolding of the font).</p>
				<p>Avoid overriding the color of visited links to make them match unvisited links, particularly in heavily
					cross-referenced works. A lack of visual distinguishment of where the reader has already been can cause
					navigation problems for some readers.</p>

					<dt>Does this rule apply to the table of contents?</dt>
					<dd><p>No, readers expect to find hyperlinks in specialized structures like the table of contents.
							Additional visual cues are not necessary in such cases, but if you mix linked and unlinked text
