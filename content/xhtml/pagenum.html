			<h2>Page Numbers</h2>

			<section id="xhtm020-desc" class="usage">
				<p>If an ebook is produced from the same workflow as a print document, print pagination markers should be
					retained in the document. These markers benefit readers in mixed print/digital environments, such as a
					classroom, as the page numbers allow a common point of reference between the two editions.</p>

				<p>Page break locations can be added to the markup using <code>span</code> and <code>div</code> tags with an
						<code>epub:type</code> attribute set to the value <code>pagebreak</code>.</p>

				<p>When including page numbers, a <a href="../nav/pagelist.html"><code>page-list nav</code></a> should also
					be included to faciliate navigation. The <code>page-list nav</code> is used to look up the location of
					the page break when the reader requests to move to a specific location. (An <code>id</code> attribute
					must be attached to each element containing a page number to allow creation of the <code>page-list
						nav</code>.)</p>

				<p>When including print page references, the package document metadata should also include <a
						href="http://idpf.org/epub3/latest/publications#sec-opf-dcsource">a <code>dc:source</code> element
						identifying the print source</a>.</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="xhtm020-faq06">Does the page number reflect the page that is ending or the page that is
						starting?</dt>
					<dd><p>The page number always reflects the page that is starting.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="xhtm020-faq07">Does the page break marker placement follow the print position?</dt>
					<dd><p>No, page break markers are always placed at the start of the page's content, regardless of whether
							the page number is printed at the top or bottom of the page in the print edition. When a user
							jumps to a specific page, they want to jump to the start of the content for that page, not the
							end.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="xhtm020-faq01">Should I include the page numbers as content or empty elements?</dt>
					<dd><p>There are pros and cons to each approach.</p>
						<p>If you include the page numbers as text content within a <code>span</code> or <code>div</code>,
							the pages will be more easily accessible to both sighted readers and readers using assistive
							technologies. This method has been employed in previous DAISY standards. The potential downside,
							however, is that mainstream reading systems will not provide equivalent functionality to turn off
							unwanted content, forcing readers to view the page numbers. Additionally, current assistive
							technologies may not provide content filtering on the <code>epub:type</code> attribute, also
							interfering with reading.</p>
						<p>Page numbers as empty elements are the more traditional mainstream approach, with anchor tags
							having served this function in the past. Using the <code>title</code> attribute on an empty
							element, however, potentially complicates the rendering/announcing of the pages. Page numbers
							that mix alphanumeric characters, for example, could not include both visual and aural
							alternatives.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="xhtm020-faq03">Why is the <code>page-list nav</code> necessary?</dt>
					<dd><p>Although the <a href="../nav/pagelist.html"><code>page-list nav</code></a> provides readers a way
							to manually look up pages, it is primarily intended to facilitate quick-access through the
							reading system. To implement a feature that can jump a reader to a specific page that they voice
							or type in, reading system need to be able to map the location quickly without having to randomly
							load and scan content files. The <code>page-list nav</code> is how these lookups occur.</p></dd>
					<dt id="xhtm020-faq04">Where do I put a page number when the page break occurs in the middle of a
						list?</dt>
					<dd><p>List often break across pages, with one item ending at the bottom of one and a new item starting
							at the top of the next. In these cases, it's not possible to locate the page number between the
							two list items, as it's not valid for a list to contain anything but list items.</p>
						<p>The obvious solutions are to either insert the page number as the very last element in the item
							that ends the page:</p>
						<pre><code>&lt;li>&#8230;.&lt;span
      epub:type="pagebreak"
      id="page24"
      title="24"/>&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>&#8230;&lt;/li>
</code></pre>
						<p>or to place it as the very first element in the list item that starts the page</p>
						<pre><code>&lt;li>&#8230;.&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>&lt;span
      epub:type="pagebreak"
      id="page24"
      title="24"/>&#8230;&lt;/li>
</code></pre>
						<p>Best practice at this time is to place the page break inside the concluding element, but both
							methods are acceptable. When included in the trailing list item, an assistive technology should
							announce the new list item that starts the next page to the reader, whereas if the page number
							starts the list item the reader may not be made aware they are in a list until reaching the next
							item.</p>
						<p>One practice to avoid is creating a new list item just for the page break. As page breaks are
							often not visible content, an empty list item will be confusing to all readers.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="xhtm020-faq05">Can I use <code>a</code> tags for page numbers?</dt>
					<dd><p>The <code>a</code> element has two specific uses defined in HTML5: for links when the
								<code>href</code> attribute is present, and for placeholder links when it is not (e.g., a
							link that might be active in another context or after some interaction by the user). As page
							breaks are not links, and are never intended to be activated as links, it is semantically
							incorrect to use them for page breaks.</p>
