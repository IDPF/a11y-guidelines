			<h2>SSML</h2>

			<section id="tts015-desc" class="usage">
				<p>SSML &#8212; the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/">Speech Synthesis Markup Language</a>
					&#8212; provides a way for content creators to enhance the default synthetic speech rendering of their
					publications at the markup level. The liberal use of SSML ensures that anyone listening to your work via
					TTS playback hears the prose as intended, not based on the best guess of their rendering engine.</p>

				<p>The <code>phoneme</code> element from SSML has been implemented in EPUB 3 as a pair of attributes for
					defining pronunciations at the markup level:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <code>ssml:alphabet</code> attribute is used to set the default phonetic alphabet.</li>
					<li>The <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute is used to define the pronunciation for any element with text
						content or for which a phonetic pronunciation can be associated (e.g., an empty element whose voicing
						is derived from an attached attribute).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>(Support for the full SSML specification is not available in EPUB 3.)</p>

				<p>Unlike <a href="pls.html">PLS lexicons</a>, SSML provides fine-grained control over pronunciation at the
					markup level. SSML can be used to override a default pronunciation for heteronyms, to correctly pronounce
					complex word and number forms, etc.</p>

				<p>To use the SSML attributes, you must first declare the SSML namespace. The declaration is typically made
					once per document on the root <code>html</code> element. (See <a href="#tts015-ex01">Example 1</a>.)</p>

				<p>A default alphabet is also typically defined once on the root <code>html</code> element, as it is rare to
					need to switch phonetic alphabets within any single document. Adding the <code>ssml:alphabet</code>
					attribute to the root ensures that all instance of the <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute have an in-scope
					alphabet defined. It is an error to define a pronunciation in an <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute without
					an in-scope alphabet, and will result in rendering errors. (See <a href="#tts015-ex01">Example
					1</a>.)</p>

				<p>When an <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute is encountered, it's value is passed to the text-to-speech (TTS)
					engine in place of the element's content, providing the lowest-level override. The pronunciation of SSML
					attributes also takes precedence over PLS lexicon entries, ensuring that heteronyms and other exceptions
					to the rule can be properly handled.</p>

				<p>Note that the value of the <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute entirely replaces the content of the element
					that it is attached to, including all descendant elements. The attribute should not be attached to a
						<code>p</code> tag to define the pronunciation of one word contained in the paragraph, for example,
					as only that one word will be read in place of the entire paragraph. The use of <code>span</code>
					elements is recommended when no markup exists on the word(s) that need a pronunciation attached.</p>

				<p>The SSML attributes are not valid on SVG or MathML content, but are valid on any XHTML content that can be
					embedded in those grammars.</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="tts005-faq01">Are lexicons supported at this time?</dt>
					<dd><p>At the time of writing, no reading systems have appeared that support the new SSML enhancements in
							EPUB 3. Please send a report if the situation changes and this page has not been
						updated.</p></dd>
					<dt id="tts005-faq02">Should I use IPA or X-SAMPA or something else to write my pronunciations?</dt>
					<dd><p>Although IPA is arguably the most widely recognized phonetic alphabet, that does not mean that it
							has full support even in existing synthetic speech engines. Some engines support only their own
							alphabets, for example. IPA is also less developer-friendly than X-SAMPA because it uses Unicode
							characters that require modifying most keyboard layouts to input, whereas X-SAMPA is ASCII-based.
							Internal workflows should be a determining factor at this time. The ultimate answer will depend
							on what engines are employed in reading systems.</p>
						<p>Note that it is possible to translate one alphabet representation to the other, so work in either
							alphabet shouldn't ever be <q>lost</q> if there does turn out to be a clear winner and loser.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="tts005-faq03">Should I use PLS lexicons or SSML?</dt>
					<dd><p>The inclusion of the technologies in EPUB 3 was not to require a choice to be made; the
							technologies are meant to complement each other. PLS lexicons allow you to define a word once and
							have the TTS engine do the work of replacing it each time it occurs in the prose. <a
								href="ssml.html">SSML</a>, on the other hand, provides the fine-grained control that is just
							not possible in a lexicon, at the price of having to tag each instance of a term that has to be
							replaced.</p>
						<p>It is possible to use SSML exclusively, but it is costly in terms of production time and can
							excessively bloat the size of your content files depending on how many unique terms have to be
							handled and how often they occur.</p>
