				<p>Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act requires that Federal agencies make their electronic and

					organizations that provide products or services to such agencies.</p>

				<p>Content creators must be committed to an accessible workflow and follow all best practices outlined
					generally here and throughout this site, however, as EPUB 3 publications are not accessible by nature of

				<p>Note that WCAG 1.0 criteria are referenced in the implementation sections as Section 508 only provides a

					<dd>
						<p>Server-side maps are instantiated using the <code>ismap</code> attribute on an image. When this
							attribute is set, a user agent is expected to send the coordinate location clicked back to the
							server (to a resource defined in the <code>href</code> of an ancestor <code>a</code> tag). There
							is no guarantee that an EPUB reading system will honor such behavior, however, as they are not
							required to be fully-compliant HTML5 user agents. EPUBs are also not guaranteed to be read in an
							online context, making server-side maps a poor markup choice.</p>
						<p>Although there is no functionality that a server-side map provides that cannot be duplicated in a
							client-side map, there is also nothing in EPUB that bars the inclusion of server-side maps.
							Adding text links for each region of the map is easily achieved, but such intrusive methods for
							compliance alone should discourage the use of these less accessible map types.</p>

						<p>If more time is permitted, the reader must be notified before the expiration. The announcement
							should be made in a live region to avoid taking focus away from the current activity (an
							assertive message would be appropriate, since a passive one may not be announced in time).</p>
						<p>Ensure the reader can easily extend the time limit, and to return to their current location. The

							extend the timer without changing focus (e.g., through a hotkey).</p>

				<p>The following paragraphs contain requirements to provide alternate modality access to content:</p>

				<ol class="none">
					<li>(a) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user vision shall
						be provided, or support for Assistive Technology used by people who are blind or visually impaired
						shall be provided.</li>
					<li>(b) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require visual acuity
						greater than 20/70 shall be provided in audio and enlarged print output working together or
						independently, or support for Assistive Technology used by people who are visually impaired shall be
						provided.</li>
					<li>(c) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user hearing shall
						be provided, or support for Assistive Technology used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing shall
						be provided.</li>
					<li>(d) Where audio information is important for the use of a product, at least one mode of operation and

						hearing devices shall be provided.</li>
					<li>(e) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user speech shall

					<li>(f) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require fine motor control

					<li>Proper use of semantic markup, and clear establishment of the logical reading order, will allow
