			<h2>About this Guide</h2>

			<section class="usage">
				<p>This guide has been designed to help guide you in the creation of accessible EPUB 3 content. It includes a
						<a href="qa/qa-checklist.html">quality assurance checklist</a> together with instruction on how to
					implement the requirements.</p>

				<p>If you are new to accessible publishing, the best place to start is with the free O'Reilly book <a
						href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025283.do">Accessible EPUB 3</a>, as it will walk you
					through the basic issues you need to understand in more detail &#8212; and with more of an instructional
					focus. The <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024897.do">EPUB 3 Best Practices</a> book
					includes the information in Accessible EPUB 3 as a chapter, but has also been expanded to include
					additional information. If you're looking for a more general purpose guide to EPUB 3 production, that
					also covers accessibility, the Best Practices guide is recommended.</p>

				<p>For general how-to questions, please create a new topic in the <a
						href="http://idpf.org/forums/epub-accessibility">IDPF accessibility discussion forum</a>. Someone
					will always try to respond!</p>
