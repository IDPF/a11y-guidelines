			<h2>Descriptions</h2>

			<section id="xhtm065-desc" class="usage">

				<p>There are many reasons why describing content adds to its accessibility for all readers. Although often
					misperceived to be useful only for non-visual readers, descriptions facilitate comprehension and provide
					context for readers with a wide range of needs. They can also assist readers whose first language may not
					be that of the text being read.</p>

				<p>This section reviews the current ARIA solution for attaching descriptions using the
						<code>aria-describedby</code> attribute.</p>

				<section id="xhtm065-desc-by">
					<h4><code>aria-describedby</code></h4>

					<p>The <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute can be used to add a description to any HTML5 element, not
						just <code>img</code>, and is the currently recommended mechanism for referencing descriptions in
						EPUB 3.</p>

					<p>The attribute references the ID of the element on the page containing the description. For
						example:</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;table aria-describedby="table-desc">
    &#8230;
&lt;table>

&lt;aside id="table-desc">
    &lt;p>The table is composed of three smaller tables
          each of which &#8230; &lt;/p>
&lt;/aside></code></pre>

					<p>Note that the ID reference does not include a hash (#) at the start, as the value is not a URI. If the
						description is spread across multiple elements, the ID of each can be listed in the attribute (this
						technique is more common for forms element descriptions).</p>

					<p>It is not required that the element containing the description be visible content. The
							<code>aria-describedby</code> attribute can point to hidden elements:</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;img &#8230; aria-describedby="img-desc"/>

&lt;aside id="img-desc" hidden="hidden">
    &#8230;
&lt;/aside></code></pre>

					<p>Before using hidden content too extensively, the ability to navigate the description is removed when
						content is not visible, as it no longer has a block or inline context. Hidden descriptions are
						typically read as one long text string.</p>

					<p>One of the primary limitations of <code>aria-describedby</code> is that the element containing the
						description must be present in the same page as the content that is being described, so it is not
						possible to reference out-of-band descriptions directly. The current workaround to this limitation is
						to reference the external description through an <code>iframe</code> element:</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;img src="bunny.jpg" aria-describedby="bunny-desc"/>

&lt;iframe id="bunny-desc" src="bunny-description.xhtml" hidden="hidden">&lt;/iframe></code></pre>

					<p>Although using an <code>iframe</code> in this fashion mimics the out-of-band functionality of the
							<code>longdesc</code> attribute (i.e., that the descriptions can be contained in separate files),
						there are a number of drawbacks:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>There is no way to reference into the content in the <code>iframe</code> from an
								<code>aria-describedby attribute</code>. In other words, you can reference specific content
							within the <code>iframe</code>; all content in the <code>iframe</code> will be rendered. Although
							this won't be problematic if your out-of-band description file only contains a single
							description, it impedes the ability to use the <a
								href="http://www.diagramcenter.org/development/content-model.html">DIAGRAM description
								framework</a>. Without customing handling, all of the descriptions in a DIAGRAM file will be
							rendered.</li>

						<li>The <code>iframe</code> will normally be announced as a separate document. Although the
								<code>seamless</code> attribute is designed to stop this behaviour in aural renderings, the
							attribute is poorly supported and also at risk of removal from HTML5.</li>

						<li>The <code>iframe</code> approach also slows down the loading of documents, since each description
							must be loaded, unlike proper out-of-band linking mechanisms, which allow the content to only be
							loaded as requested by the reader.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Although the usability of <code>aria-describedby</code> decreases the less simple your description
						requirements are, it is the most viable solution at this time.</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Why link to visible descriptions?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Even though a description is a visible part of the current page, linking to it provides a
							programmatic means for users of assistive technologies to rapidly access the description without
							having to hunt through the page content.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Why not <code>longdesc</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>longdesc</code> attribute is an HTML5 extension not currently supported by EPUB. It is
							also limited to being attached to <code>img</code> elements.</p>
