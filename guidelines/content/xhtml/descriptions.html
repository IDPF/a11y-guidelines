			<h2>Descriptions</h2>

			<section id="xhtm065-desc" class="usage">

				<p>There are many reasons why describing content adds to its accessibility for all readers. Although often
					considered only useful for non-visual readers, descriptions facilitate comprehension and provide context
					for readers with a wide range of needs. They can also assist readers whose first language may not be that
					of the text being read.</p>

				<section id="xhtm065-hyperlinks">
					<h4><code>hyperlinks</code></h4>

					<p>Plain old hyperlinks remain the most widely accessible way to provide a link to a description.</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;figure>
   &lt;img src="crime-map.jpg" alt="Crime in Gotham City">
   &lt;a href="crime-desc.xhtml">Description&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure></code></pre>

					<p>The primary advantage of hyperlinks is that they are exposed to all users, unlike the
							<code>aria-describedby</code> attribute described in the next section. Their primary disadvantage
						is that they are always visible, and publishers are often prevented from adding any visble content by
						their agreements with authors.</p>

					<p>Note that a hyperlink does not always have to reference a description in another document;
						descriptions might be included at the end of a section, like footnotes.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="xhtm065-desc-by">
					<h4><code>aria-describedby</code></h4>

					<p>The <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute can be used to add a description to any HTML5 element, not
						just <code>img</code>, and is the currently recommended mechanism for referencing descriptions in
						EPUB 3.</p>

					<p>The attribute references the ID of the element on the page containing the description. For
						example:</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;table aria-describedby="table-desc">
    &#8230;
&lt;table>

&lt;aside id="table-desc">
    &lt;p>The table is composed of three smaller tables
          each of which &#8230; &lt;/p>
&lt;/aside></code></pre>

					<p>Note that the ID reference does not include a hash (#) at the start. If the description is spread
						across multiple elements, the ID of each can be listed in the attribute.</p>

					<p>It is not required that the element containing the description be visible content. The
							<code>aria-describedby</code> attribute can point to hidden elements:</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;img &#8230; aria-describedby="img-desc"/>

&lt;aside id="img-desc" hidden="hidden">
    &#8230;
&lt;/aside></code></pre>

					<p>Before using hidden content too extensively, be aware that the ability to navigate the description is
						removed when content is not visible. Hidden descriptions are read as one long text string that the
						user has to listen to in its entirety.</p>

					<p>One of the primary limitations of <code>aria-describedby</code> is that the element containing the
						description must be present in the same page as the content that is being described, so it is not
						possible to reference out-of-band descriptions directly. The workaround to this limitation is to
						reference the external description through an <code>iframe</code> element:</p>

					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;img src="bunny.jpg" aria-describedby="bunny-desc"/>

&lt;iframe id="bunny-desc" src="bunny-description.xhtml" hidden="hidden">&lt;/iframe></code></pre>

					<p>Although using an <code>iframe</code> in this fashion mimics the out-of-band functionality of the
							<code>longdesc</code> attribute, there are a number of drawbacks:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>There is no way to reference into the content in the <code>iframe</code> from an
								<code>aria-describedby attribute</code>; all content in the <code>iframe</code> will be
							read.</li>

						<li>The <code>iframe</code> will be announced as a separate document.</li>

						<li>Using many <code>iframe</code> elements slows down the loading of documents, since each
							description must be loaded, unlike proper out-of-band linking mechanisms, which allow the content
							to only be loaded as requested by the reader.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Why link to visible descriptions?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Even though a description is a visible part of the current page, linking to it provides a
							programmatic means for users of assistive technologies to rapidly access the description without
							having to hunt through the page content.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Why not <code>longdesc</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>longdesc</code> attribute is an HTML5 extension not currently supported by EPUB. It is
							also limited to being attached to <code>img</code> elements.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Why not <code>aria-details</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>aria-details</code> attribute is currently under development and not supported by
							assistive technologies. It will allow an association to be made with a description in a
								<code>details</code> element. Although similar to <code>aria-describedby</code>, the
								<code>aria-details</code> attribute will not result in stringified content (i.e., the user
							will be able to navigate the description as structured HTML).</p>
