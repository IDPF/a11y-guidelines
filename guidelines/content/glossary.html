				<h3>A</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="at">Assistive Technology (AT)</dt>
					<dd><p>An assistive technology, in the context of EPUB 3, is either a device or software program capable
							of rendering content in ways that facilitate reading by persons with disabilities. An assistive
							technology may be fully integrated into the reading system (an accessible reading system) or may
							work in conjunction with hardware and software to provide a reading experience better tailored to
							the reader's preferred modality (e.g., screen-reading software, content zooming technologies and
							refreshable braille displays).</p></dd>

				<h3>C</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="author">Content Author (or Author)</dt>
					<dd><p>The person or organization directly responsible for creating an EPUB publication and ensuring the
							quality and accessibility of the final product.</p></dd>
					<dt id="provider">Content Provider</dt>
					<dd><p>The organization directly responsible for providing EPUB content to readers, whether through an
							online bookstore, corporate Web site, library lending program or otherwise.</p></dd>
					<dt id="cmt">Core Media Type</dt>
					<dd><p>A content format that all EPUB reading systems must support to ensure interoperability of content
							across devices. All compliant devices are required to be able to process XHTML5 and SVG
							documents, MP3 and MP4 audio, a variety of common image formats, etc. For a complete list, see <a
								href="http://idpf.org/epub3/latest/publications#sec-core-media-types">Section 5.1</a> of the
							EPUB Publications 3.0.1 specification.</p>
						<p>An EPUB publication can contain other content formats, but must provide a fallback that is in one
							of the supported Core Media Types.</p></dd>
					<dt id="css">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</dt>
					<dd><p>The Cascading Style Sheet language is used to control the rendering of content on reading systems
							with a visual display screen, but does provide capabilities for rendering in other media such as
							braille and aural.</p></dd>
					<dt id="css-viewport">CSS Viewport</dt>
					<dd><p>A screen on a reading system capable of visually rendering the EPUB using the defined CSS
							styles.</p></dd>
				</dl>

				<h3>D</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="daisy">DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System)</dt>
					<dd><p>The DAISY Consortium is an organization that has been advocating for accessible publishing
							practices, and that has developed a talking book format specially designed to enable reading by
							readers with print disabilities. The functionality provided in the ANSI/NISO Z39.86 standard
							maintained by the Consortium has been fully integrated in EPUB 3.</p></dd>
					<dt id="diagram">DIAGRAM (Digital Image and Graphic Resources for Accessible Materials)</dt>
					<dd><p>The DIAGRAM project seeks to make image and graphic content more accessible by defining a content
							model for writing descriptions and including alternate representations. More information can be
							found at the <a href="http://www.diagramcenter.org">DIAGRAM Center Web site</a>.</p></dd>
					<dt id="dom">DOM (Document Object Model)</dt>
					<dd><p>The document object model is how the markup content you create gets internalized by a processing
							agent such as a reading system or browser. Instead of tags and attributes, the DOM is typically
							likened to a tree full of branches, where each branch represents the parent/child relationships
							of the document.</p>
						<p>When talking about how reading system and assistive technologies interact with content, it is more
							appropriate to relate behaviors to the DOM, since the DOM is not necessarily an exact
							representation of the originating content (e.g., a reading system may standardize the HTML markup
							as it process a document or an assistive technology may enahnce the information to facilitate
							rendering and interaction).</p></dd>

				<h3>E</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="ebook">ebook</dt>
					<dd><p>Any book produced in an electronic format is an ebook. Ebooks may be in EPUB, Microsoft Word, PDF,
							text, MOBI or a wide variety of other formats.</p></dd>
					<dt id="escapable">Escapable</dt>
					<dd><p>The ability for non-visual readers to leave the current structure that is being read and continue
							reading at the next logical spot. Readers will often not want to listen to entire tables and
							lists being read out, but will expect the reading system to provide a means to jumping out from
							them at any point.</p></dd>
					<dt id="epub">EPUB</dt>
					<dd>EPUB is the ebook format maintained by the <a href="#idpf">IDPF</a>.</dd>
					<dt id="container">EPUB Container (or Container)</dt>
					<dd><p>The container is the ZIP file format and metadata used to bundle all the resources that make up an
							EPUB for distribution (the .epub file that readers receive when they purchase or otherwise obtain
							the publication). The container format is defined in the <a
								href="http://idpf.org/epub3/latest/ocf">EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0.1</a>
							specification.</p></dd>
					<dt id="contentdoc">EPUB Content Document</dt>
					<dd><p>EPUB content documents are what get rendered to readers. They can be in either XHTML5 or SVG.
							Other formats may also be included, but a fallback in one of these two formats is required by the
								<a href="#cmt">core media type</a> restrictions.</p></dd>
					<dt id="nav">EPUB Navigation Document</dt>
					<dd><p>The EPUB navigation document provides structural navigation for readers. The document is designed
							to be rendered by reading systems for navigation purposes (i.e., the table of contents option
							offered by the reading system itself), but by using the XHTML5 grammar the documents can also be
							embedded as table of contents within the publication itself.</p></dd>
					<dt id="pub">EPUB Publication (or Publication)</dt>
					<dd><p>An EPUB publication is the </p></dd>
					<dt id="rs">EPUB Reading System (or Reading System)</dt>
					<dd><p>An EPUB reading system is a device capable of rendering an EPUB. A reading system may be a single
							dedicated device or it could be a combination of hardware and software and assistive technology.
							An iPad on its own is not a reading system, for example, but when iBooks is run on it the
							hardware and software constitute a reading system. Discussions about accessible reading systems
							are complicated by the wide variety of interplay that is possible between devices and
							software.</p></dd>
					<dt id="epubcss">EPUB Style Sheet (or Style Sheet)</dt>
					<dd><p>The CSS styles that reading systems are expected to support. These are defined in <a
								href="http://idpf.org/epub3/latest/contentdocs#sec-css">Section 3</a> of tbe EPUB Content
							Documents 3.0 specification.</p></dd>

				<h3>F</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="foreign">Foreign Resource</dt>
					<dd><p>Foreign resources are the opposite of <a href="#cmt">core media types</a>: resources that are not
							supported by all EPUB reading systems so require fallbacks. Foreign does not mean that these
							resources can be hosted outside the <a href="#container">container</a>.</p></dd>
				</dl>
			</section>

			<section class="glossdiv">
				<h3>H</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="outline">HTML5 Outlining Algorithm</dt>
					<dd><p>A new algorithm defined in HTML5 for creating a document outline from the headings used in a
							document. Unless enclosed in an <code>hgroup</code> tag, each heading defines a new section,
							regardless of whether the author explicitly included section tags or not.</p></dd>
				</dl>

				<h3>I</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="idpf">IDPF (International Digital Publishing Forum)</dt>
					<dd><p>The International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) is the global trade and standards organization
							dedicated to the development and promotion of electronic publishing and content consumption.</p>
						<p>The work of the IDPF promotes the development of electronic publishing applications and products
							that will benefit creators of content, makers of reading systems, and consumers. The IDPF
							develops and maintains the EPUB content publication standard that enables the creation and
							transport of reflowable digital books and other types of content as digital publications that are
							interoperable between disparate EPUB-compliant reading devices and applications.</p>
					</dd>

			<section class="glossdiv">
				<h3>M</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="manifest">Manifest</dt>
					<dd><p>The manifest is the section of the package document that lists all the resources in the
						EPUB.</p></dd>
					<dt id="mathml">MathML</dt>
					<dd><p>A markup grammar for tagging mathmatical equations, enabling both their visual rendering and
							voicing for more accurate and accessible comprehension.</p></dd>
					<dt id="mathspeak">MathSpeak</dt>
					<dd><p><a href="http://www.gh-mathspeak.com/">MathSpeak</a> is natural language grammar for voicing
							MathML elements.</p></dd>
					<dt id="overlay">Media Overlay Document</dt>
					<dd><p>Media overlays define the sequence of text/audio synchronization points used to traverse the
							documents in a publication. When the reader turns on playback, the reading system uses these
							documents to resynchronize the visual display with the audio playback.</p></dd>
				</dl>
			</section>

			<section class="glossdiv">
				<h3>N</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="ncx">NCX (Navigation Control file for XML Applications)</dt>
					<dd><p>The EPUB 2.0 equivalent of the EPUB navigation document. Although no longer a part of EPUB 3, NCX
							documents can be included to enable forwards-compatibility in older reading systems that may not
							recognize all of EPUB 3 but are able to render most of the XHTML content.</p></dd>
				</dl>
			</section>

			<section class="glossdiv">
				<h3>O</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="ocf">OCF</dt>
					<dd><p>OCF is another name for the <a href="#container">EPUB container</a>.</p></dd>
					<dt id="oebps">OEBPS</dt>
					<dd><p>OEBPS stands for Open EBook Publication Structure, which was the precursor specification to EPUB
							2.0. This acronym was often found used as the directory name where EPUB 2.0 content was stored in
							the container, but was never required and is not recommended moving forward.</p></dd>
					<dt id="ops">OPS</dt>
					<dd><p>OPS stands for Open Publication Structure. This specification has been renamed to EPUB
							Publications 3.0. Similar to <a href="#oebps">OEBPS</a>, OPS was often used as the directory name
							where EPUB 2.0 content was stored.</p></dd>
				</dl>

			<section class="glossdiv">
				<h3>P</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="package">Package Document</dt>
					<dd><p>The package document is an XML file that contains metadata about the publication, the resource
							list (<a href="#manifest">manifest</a>) and the spine.</p></dd>
					<dt id="opf">Package File (or OPF file)</dt>
					<dd><p>The package document was called the package file in EPUB 2.0. It is still often referred to as the
							OPF file because of the name of the specification it was defined in in EPUB 2.0 (the Open
							Packaging Format).</p></dd>
					<dt id="pubres">Publication Resource</dt>
					<dd><p>A resource that is required in order to render the publication. Most publication resources are
							bundled in the container, but some &#8212; like audio and video &#8212; can be hosted on the
							Web.</p></dd>
				</dl>

				<h3>R</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="reader">Reader</dt>
					<dd><p>The person who consumes an EPUB.</p></dd>
					<dt id="remoteres">Remote Resource</dt>
					<dd><p>A publication resource that is not included in the container. Audio and video resources are
							allowed to be housed on the Web because of their potential size. Resources referenced in package
							document <code>link</code> elements can also live outside the contianer (e.g., metadata
							records).</p></dd>
